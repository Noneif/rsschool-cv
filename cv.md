**Brief info about me:** a kitchen nerd and funkiller, but a good person.

**About the desire to learn and learn new things:** since childhood, I have liked to spend time with different tools, disassemble, assemble and upgrade various appliances, but to carry out such manipulations without studying the “research subjects” is almost impossible and not even interesting. In programming, these conventions are also present.

**Why programming?** - Home appliances are over.

**An interesting fact:** most of my life I wander around different educational institutions, I didn’t quit any, all of them were with sheepskin.
